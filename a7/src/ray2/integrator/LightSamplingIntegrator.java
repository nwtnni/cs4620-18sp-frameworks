/**
 * An Integrator that works by sampling light sources.  It accounts for light that illuminates all surfaces

	/* 
	 * The illumination algorithm is:
	 * 
	 *   0. light source emission:
	 *      if the surface is a light source:
	 *        add the source's radiance
	 *   1. light sources:
	 *      for each light in the scene
	 *        choose a point on the light
	 *        evaluate the BRDF
	 *        do a shadow test
	 *        compute the estimate of this light's contribution 
	 *          as (source radiance) * brdf * attenuation * (cos theta) / pdf, and add it
	 *   2. environment:
	 *      choose a direction from the environment
	 *      evaluate the BRDF
	 *      do a shadow test
	 *      compute the estimate of the environment's contribution
	 *        as (env radiance) * brdf * (cos theta) / pdf, and add it
	 *   3. mirror reflections and refractions:
	 *      choose a direction from the BSDF, continuing only if it is discrete
	 *      trace a recursive ray
	 *      add the recursive radiance weighted by (cos theta) * (brdf value) / (probability)
	 *      
	 * Step 3 is violating the idea of light source sampling a bit, but it is needed because it's impossible
	 * to choose a light source point exactly in the reflection or refraction direction, and we do like to be 
	 * able to see the reflections.  By making the recursive call only for directions chosen discretely 
	 * (that is, directions belonging to perfectly sharp reflection and refraction components) we are leaving out
	 * diffuse and glossy interreflections.
	 * 
	 * In Step 1 note that the attenuation includes the inverse square law and also the cosine at the source's
	 * end of the ray that is required by the illumination integral for an area source.  This is taken care of
	 * by the Light subclasses: Point light sets its attenuation to 1 / r^2 whereas RectangleLight sets the 
	 * attenuation to (cos theta_source) / r^2.
	 *
