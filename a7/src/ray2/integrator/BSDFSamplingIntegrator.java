/**

	/* 
	 * The illumination algorithm is:
	 * 
	 *   0. light source emission:
	 *      if the surface is a light source:
	 *        add the source's radiance
	 *   1. reflected radiance:
	 *      generate a sample from the BSDF
	 *      trace a ray in that direction
	 *      if you hit nothing:
	 *        look up incident radiance from the environment
	 *      if you hit a surface:
	 *        for discrete directions, shade the ray recursively to get incident radiance
	 *        for non-discrete, incident radiance is source radiance if you hit a source (else 0)
	 *      compute the estimate for reflected radiance as incident radiance * brdf * cos theta / pdf
	 *   2. point light source:
	 *      for each point light in the scene:
	 *        compute the light direction and distance
	 *        evaluate the BRDF
	 *        add a contribution to the reflected radiance due to that source
	 * 
	 * For this integrator, step 1 automatically includes light from all sources (area sources and
	 * the environment) but step 2 is needed because point lights can't be hit by rays.
	 * 
	 * In step 1, by making the recursive call only for directions chosen discretely (that is, 
	 * directions belonging to perfectly sharp reflection and refraction components) we are leaving 
	 * out diffuse and glossy interreflections.
